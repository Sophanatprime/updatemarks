# updatemarks
A LaTeX package is used to update marks in boxes.

You can use `\usepackage[minipage,multicol,tcolorbox]{updatemarks}` in the preamble 
of your document so that marks in these environments can be found by LaTeX.
You are able to use `\ExtractMarks` or `\ExtractSplitMarks` to save marks and 
use `\UpdateMarks` to reinsert marks. Read the documentation for more details.
